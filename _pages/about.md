I am a Ph.D. student at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). Under the guidance of Prof. [Namwoo Kang](https://www.smartdesignlab.org/people/professor), I am conducting research at the intersection of the rigor of physics and the creativity of AI. Under the overarching theme of "AI-driven Design Optimization," my goal is to redefine how AI can be effectively utilized in engineering, offering a fresh perspective that diverges from traditional methodologies. Additionally, as an AI researcher at [Narnia Labs](https://www.narnia.ai/?r=0), I collaborate with global companies, addressing real-world industrial challenges. My aim is to propose general algorithms that can be broadly applied across various industries, rather than focusing solely on domain-specific solutions that are restricted to laboratory settings.

I am also a co-founder of [Narnia Labs](https://www.narnia.ai/?r=0) and have completed a minor in Entrepreneurship at KAIST's [K-School]([https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/](https://kschool.kaist.ac.kr/Eng/Index). This reflects my deep interest in the startup ecosystem, and I aspire to take a deep dive into this ecosystem as a proactive player in the future.

Prior to joining KAIST, I earned my Master's degree from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) and a Bachelor's degree in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mech.inha.ac.kr/mech/index.do) from Inha University, Korea.
